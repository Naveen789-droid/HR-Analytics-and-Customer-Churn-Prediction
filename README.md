# Internship Projects â€“ HR Analytics & Customer Churn Prediction

##  Overview
This repository contains two Machine Learning projects completed as part of my internship.  
Both projects focus on **employee/customer behavior analytics** and predicting attrition/churn using classification models.

---

##  Project 1: HR Analytics â€“ Employee Attrition Prediction
### Objective
To analyze employee data and build a model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

### Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, removed irrelevant columns  
   - Encoded categorical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Attrition distribution  
   - Attrition by department, age, income, job role  
   - Key influencing features  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression (with class balancing)  
   - Train-test split for validation  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy: ~72%  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

5. **Key Insights**  
   - Overtime, job role, marital status, and stock options were major drivers of attrition.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 2: Telco Customer Churn Prediction
### Objective
To predict customer churn in a telecom dataset and identify factors contributing to churn.

### Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Fixed `TotalCharges` column  
   - Encoded categorical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Churn distribution  
   - Churn by contract type, tenure, internet service  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression (with class balancing)  
   - Train-test split for validation  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy: ~80% (approx, depending on split)  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

5. **Key Insights**  
   - Customers with short tenure, month-to-month contracts, and high charges were more likely to churn.
